Why use 

1≤n≤1000
1≤x≤10^5

vector<vector<int>> t(n+1, vector<int>(x+1, 0)) instead of vector<vector<int>> t(x+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0)) ???

for (i = 0 to size)
  for (j = 0 to size)
    do something with ary[i][j]

will run faster than the following:

for (i = 0 to size)
  for (j = 0 to size)
    do something with ary[j][i]
