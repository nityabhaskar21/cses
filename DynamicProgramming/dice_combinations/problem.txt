Your task is to count the number of ways to construct sum n by throwing a dice one or more times. 
Each throw produces an outcome between 1 and 6.

For example, if n=3, there are 4 ways:
1+1+1
1+2
2+1
3
Input

The only input line has an integer n.

Output

Print the number of ways modulo 109+7.

Constraints
