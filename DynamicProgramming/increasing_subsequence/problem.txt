You are given an array containing n integers. 
Your task is to determine the longest increasing subsequence in the array, 
i.e., the longest subsequence where every element is larger than the previous one.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array 
by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input

The first line contains an integer n: the size of the array.

After this there are n integers x1,x2,…,xn: the contents of the array.

Output

Print the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Constraints
1≤n≤2⋅10^5
1≤xi≤10^9

Example

Input:
8
7 3 5 3 6 2 9 8

Output:
4
