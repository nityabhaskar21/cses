Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. 
Your task is to produce a sum of money x using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.

For example, if the coins are {1,5,7} and the desired sum is 11, an optimal solution is 5+5+1 which requires 3 coins.

Input

The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.

The second line has n distinct integers c1,c2,…,cn: the value of each coin.

Output 

Print one integer: the minimum number of coins. If it is not possible to produce the desired sum, print −1.

Constraints
1≤n≤100
1≤x≤10^6
1≤ci≤10^6
