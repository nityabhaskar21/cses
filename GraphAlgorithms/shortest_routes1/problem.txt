There are n cities and m flight connections between them. 
Your task is to determine the length of the shortest route from Syrjälä to every city.

Input

The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flight connections. 
The cities are numbered 1,2,…,n, and city 1 is Syrjälä.

After that, there are m lines describing the flight connections. 
Each line has three integers a, b and c: a flight begins at city a, ends at city b, and its length is c. 
Each flight is a one-way flight.

You can assume that it is possible to travel from Syrjälä to all other cities.

Output

Print n integers: the shortest route lengths from Syrjälä to cities 1,2,…,n.

Constraints
1≤n≤10^5
1≤m≤2⋅10^5
1≤a,b≤n
1≤c≤10^9
