There are n cities and m roads between them. 
Your task is to process q queries where you have to determine the 
length of the shortest route between two given cities.

Input

The first input line has three integers n, m and q: the number of cities, roads, and queries.

Then, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has three integers a, b and c: 
there is a road between cities a and b whose length is c. All roads are two-way roads.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers a and b: 
determine the length of the shortest route between cities a and b.

Output

Print the length of the shortest route for each query. If there is no route, print −1 instead.
