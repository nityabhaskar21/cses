Consider a game where there are n children (numbered 1,2,…,n) in a circle. During the game, 
every second child is removed from the circle, until there are no children left.

Your task is to process q queries of the form: "when there are n children, 
who is the kth child that will be removed?"

Input

The first input line has an integer q: the number of queries.

After this, there are q lines that describe the queries. 
Each line has two integers n and k: the number of children and the position of the child.

Output

Print q integers: the answer for each query.

Constraints
