// CSES uses OpenJDK 1.8.0_91 (Java 8).

// Name your code file according to the java rules. 
// The file containing class called Main should be upload as Main.java. 
// The code must not be in any packages or the compilation will fail.

// Java's default Scanner and System.out.println may be too slow for input and output. 
// The runtime environment contains a faster class for handling input and output called IO. 
// It doesn't need to be imported as it resides in the same directory as the program. 
// You can use IO class as follows:

public class JavaSumbission {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // IO io = new IO();
        
        // String a = io.next(); // Reads the next string separated by spaces.
        // int b = io.nextInt(); // Reads the next int separated by spaces.
        // long c = io.nextLong(); // Reads the next long separated by spaces.
        // double d = io.nextDouble(); // Reads the next double separated by spaces.
        
        // // Works like System.out.println.
        // io.println("Input was " + a + " " + b + " " + c + " " + d);
        
        // io.close(); // MUST BE CALLED IN THE END, otherwise some of the output may be missing
    }
