Your task is to calculate the number of strings of length n 
having a given pattern of length m as their substring. All strings consist of characters A–Z.

Input

The first input line has an integer n: the length of the final string.

The second line has a pattern of length m.

Output

Print the number of strings modulo 109+7.

Constraints
1≤n≤1000
1≤m≤100

Example

Input:
6
ABCDB

Output:
52

Explanation: The final string will be of the form ABCDBx or xABCDB where x is any character between A–Z.
