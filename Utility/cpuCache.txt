Why use 

1≤n≤1000
1≤x≤10^5

vector<vector<int>> t(n+1, vector<int>(x+1, 0)) instead of vector<vector<int>> t(x+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0)) ???

for (i = 0 to size)
  for (j = 0 to size)
    do something with ary[i][j]

will run faster than the following:

for (i = 0 to size)
  for (j = 0 to size)
    do something with ary[j][i]    

The reason this is cache inefficient is because 
modern CPUs will load the cache line with "near" memory addresses from main memory 
when you access a single memory address. We are iterating through the "j" (outer) rows in the array in the inner loop, 
so for each trip through the inner loop, 
the cache line will cause to be flushed and loaded with a line of addresses that are near to the [j][i] entry.
